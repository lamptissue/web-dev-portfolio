                Alex Jeffrey, a clockmaker known for notable projects like the Big Ben restoration, needed a website.
                The goal was to highlight his work and allow him to independently update it. The result is a
                mobile-responsive site showcasing his projects and ensuring easy updates on the go.

              <h4>Objective</h4>
              <p>
                The aim of this project was to create a website that not only exhibits Alex's work but also provides him
                with the capability to independently update content and images.
              </p>
              <h4>Approach</h4>
              <p>
                The first step in the process was understanding Alex's specific needs for his website. Looking at Alex's
                work it was clear that he has an impressive portoflio and it was important to showcase this. I suggested
                the inclusion of a case study page to spotlight his projects. At this initial stage, Figma proved to be
                an invaluable tool for collaboration. It allowed Alex to preview an early prototype of the website, and
                gave him the opportunity to suggest any specific images or text he wanted to be included.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the design evolved, it became evident from Alex's feedback that a minimalist approach was necessary.
                The design needed to step back and allow Alex's work to truly shine, with a clear call to action
                prominently displayed on the homepage.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center col-lg-5">
              <img src="img/alex-jeffrey-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded py-3" />
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg">
                <p>
                  The choice to use WordPress as a platform was crucial to the project's success. It provided Alex with
                  the flexibility to update his website as needed. Utilising plugins such as Advanced Custom Fields
                  (ACF) for specific purposes and WP-Forms allowed visitors to easily submit requests, streamlining
                  interactions and making the website more user-friendly. I used WordPress's posts feature to create
                  individual case studies and using through PHP loops which would populate the case studies page
                  dynamically.This approach eliminated the need for hardcoding each entry, ensuring that any new case
                  studies would be automatically added into the page.

                  <img src="img/home-layout.png" class="img-fluid rounded" />
                </div>
                <p class="subtitle">Progress made from the original design to the final</p>
              </div>
            </div>

                <h4>Learnings</h4>
                <p>
                  Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to enhance my technical skills. My experience with
                  JavaScript made it easier for me to understand PHP loops which was important using WordPress posts
                  efficently. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of web components, further expanding my
                  capabilities in website development.
