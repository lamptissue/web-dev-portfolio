                Chat App is a mobile app that is built using React Native. It
                allows users both on IOS and Android to communicate with each
                other through a chat interface. Users can also share images and
                their location, as well as take and send photos directly through
                the app.

              <h4>Objective</h4>
              <p>
                The aim was to build an app that would work on both IOS and
                Android devices and make use of features on both types of
                devices. The problem I was trying to solve was to create an
                application without having to use other languages such as Swift
                or Java.
              </p>
              <h4>Approach</h4>
              <p>
                I built a Chat App using React Native, Expo, and Firebase. My
                previous experience with HTML, CSS, and React proved to be very
                helpful in this project. The project began with learning about
                basic layout and styling by creating a 'hello world' app and
                experimenting with different colours and layouts.
              </p>

              <p>
                The next steps were to build a second screen that would
                eventually serve as the chat feature. To accomplish this, I
                broke the project down into smaller pieces so that each
                component could be implemented and tested individually.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the first components I built was a start screen that
                prompts the user to enter their name and allows them to change
                the background colour. I started by implementing a basic chat
                interface using Gift and then integrated Firebase to store
                messages. I tested the chat interface using an emulator and my
                device to ensure that it was working correctly and that the
                conversation was being stored in Firebase as expected. In the
                final stage, I added additional features such as the ability to
                add photos and share location, making use of the device's native
                features such as the camera.
              </p>
              <h4>Problems</h4>
              <p>
                During the development process, I encountered a few challenges
                that required troubleshooting and problem-solving. For example,
                the app continued to crash, which was caused by incorrect code.
                To resolve this, I had to debug using the prompts provided in
                the terminal. Additionally, I encountered issues with outdated
                code in the examples I was using, which I was able to overcome
                by consulting the Expo documentation to find the latest methods.
                Despite these challenges, I was able to successfully navigate
                and overcome them, producing a working application that is now
                included in my portfolio.
